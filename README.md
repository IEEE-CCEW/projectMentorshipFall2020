Rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 ,timely quarantine and medical treatment in absence of any vaccine is necessity of time to prevent and control of this pandemic.
Therefore, an alternative diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 cases utilizing available resources such as Image Processing and advanced deep learning techniques is proposed in this work.
The proposed method is implemented in four phases, viz., data collection through kaggle, Image Processing & Compare with given sample, predicting and calculating using ML, display of result.
